Project: Client-Server Game Architecture

This document provides a fully elaborated blueprint for a client-server game architecture, detailing every component from the developer's creative tools to the player's in-game experience. The system is designed to be cohesive, scalable, and secure, with a focus on data integrity and modular development.



1\. The Core Architecture

The game's foundation is a client-server model unified by a shared set of Game Datafiles. This architecture separates the game's logic (Server) from the player's interface (Client), ensuring a consistent and secure experience for everyone.



The Editor: A comprehensive development tool that allows for world-building and live-editing of the game. It is the single point of creation for all static game content.



The Client: The player-facing application. It handles all visual rendering, player input, and communication with the server.



The Server: The game's central authority. It hosts the game world, processes all logic, and manages player data.



Game Datafiles: Encrypted files containing all the static information that defines the game world, from maps to item properties. They act as the "source of truth" and are synchronized between the Editor, Client, and Server.



2\. The Editor: The Creation \& Live-Editing Tool

The Editor is a powerful application that serves as both the primary development tool and a live-editing client. It provides a visual and intuitive way to build the game world and its behaviors.



A. Main Interface \& Global Features

The Editor's interface is built around a logical menu bar and a quick-access toolbar for efficient navigation.



Menu Bar: The central hub for all major functions.



File: Manages project files, including creating new ones, saving, compiling .use code, building the final game, and exiting.



Artwork: Handles the import of .png files that serve as the visual assets for the game's sprites and tilesets.



Edit: Provides standard editing tools like Cut, Copy, and Paste, which can be applied to tiles, objects, and chunks.



Game Data: A critical menu that gives access to the various specialized editors (Map, Object, Animation, etc.).



Usecodes: Manages the game's scripting, allowing developers to open existing scripts or create new ones for specific objects.



Export: Compiles and packages the game. This menu can export a standalone client, a headless server, and even specialized files for weapons and armor.



View: Customizes the user interface by toggling the visibility of the Toolbar, Status Bar, and other UI elements.



Toolbar: A set of icons that provide one-click access to the most frequently used functions, such as save, cut, copy, and paste. It also includes tools for navigation (Zoom, Toggle Grid) and a Layer Mode that lets developers switch between editing terrain, placing game data objects, or just working with raw tiles.



Asset Filtering: A set of dropdown menus to help developers quickly find the right sprite or asset. They can filter by Artwork Source (ORIGINAL vs. IMPORTED) and by Category (e.g., "Weapons," "Armor," "Npcs").



B. Specialized Editors

The Editor includes several specialized tools for specific tasks, all accessible through the "Game Data" menu.



Map Editor: The main tool for world-building, where the developer lays out the game's physical world.



Features: Includes a large grid workspace that represents the game world, an overlay grid to assist with precise tile and object placement, and a Palette containing all available sprites.



Functionality: Developers can "paint" different terrains (grass, water, roads), place objects (buildings, trees, items), and manage large sections of the map using Chunk modes.



Chunk Mode: A powerful feature that allows the developer to select a block of tiles and objects as a "chunk." Using the mouse wheel, they can cycle through predefined chunk sizes like 4x4, 8x8, and 16x16, allowing for rapid duplication of large, complex areas.



Object Type Editor: The tool for defining the properties and behaviors of every in-game entity.



Features: Assigns a name and a "family" (e.g., Weapon, Armor, Npc) to an object.



Properties: A detailed panel allows developers to set an object's characteristics, including Physical properties (Weight, Mass), Gameplay properties (Collectible, Is Container), and Visual properties (Illuminates, Brightness).



Assignment: Links an object to a visual sprite from the palette and an animation. The most crucial feature here is the "Edit Usecode" button, which connects the object to its scripting behavior.



Animation Editor: A tool for creating and managing animated sequences for characters and objects. It allows developers to assemble individual sprite frames into a fluid animation and set its playback speed.



C. Core Development Workflow

The Editor promotes a streamlined workflow by separating concerns into logical steps:



Artwork Import: The developer first imports all of the game's art assets as .png files.



Object Definition: They then use the Object Type Editor to define every object and item in the game, assigning a visual sprite and setting its core properties.



Animation Creation: The Animation Editor is used to create animated sequences for dynamic elements like characters and flickering torches.



Map Design: The Map Editor is used to build the game world. The asset filtering and chunk tools allow the developer to efficiently place the previously defined objects onto the map.



Scripting: The Usecodes menu is used to add custom logic and behavior to the game's objects.



Export: Finally, the Export menu compiles all the created data and assets into the final, obfuscated game files for distribution.



3\. The Usecode and Scripting System

The usecode system is the backbone of all object-based interactions. It's an event-driven scripting language that allows for a high degree of customization without modifying the core game engine.



A. The .use File Language

.use files define object behaviors based on a simple, readable format.



Core Syntax:



Objects: The central building blocks. An Object declaration defines a named template for an item or character (e.g., Object "Saw"). Many objects of the same type can exist in the game, but they all share the same instructions.



Events: These are the triggers for action. They are declared with a special keyword followed by a code block in curly braces {}. For example, the OnUse event is triggered when a player uses an object, and the OnLook event is triggered when they inspect it.



Commands: Pre-defined actions the game engine can take, essentially built-in functions. The Print command displays a message, Create spawns a new object, and TestSkill checks a player's skill level.



Variables \& Properties: Objects and players have properties that can be accessed and modified, such as player.health and object.quality. These are used to store state and control the flow of logic.



B. API Calls \& The Editor's Role

The Editor translates a developer's visual inputs into .use code via a series of backend API calls. The user never needs to manually write code; the editor generates it for them.



POST /api/object/use: For defining an object's primary function when used by a player. The editor would translate a user's form input (e.g., "heal player for 10-20 health") into the OnUse script.



GET /api/object/look: To define descriptive text for an item based on its properties. The editor would provide a form for the developer to write different descriptions for an item's durability (e.g., "dull and rusty" for low quality).



POST /api/object/equip: To set requirements for equipping an item based on player properties (e.g., requiring a certain skill level or alignment).



POST /api/event/run: A generic endpoint for handling events like OnDeath, which creates a new object (e.g., a dead body) and transfers items.



POST /api/teleport: To handle all forms of player and object movement, such as a recall wand or a ship deed.



4\. The Client: The Player's Interface

The Client is the application players run. It's designed to be a user-friendly and secure entry point into the game world.



A. Login System

The client's first screen is a detailed login interface.



UI Elements: Includes fields for an account, password, and a Login button. A separate Create Account button directs to a registration form that also includes a field for an email address.



Login Progress: A percentage bar displays the progress of the login process, including server connection and file synchronization.



Security: The registration form takes a password and an email. The password is SHA hashed before being sent to the server for maximum security.



Safe Re-Log: Players can safely re-log at any time. Their progress is saved, and on the next login, the client will perform a checksum to download any new game datafiles.



Global Chat: A live chat window displays messages about in-game events, like new items spawning.



B. Player \& Stat UI

Once logged in, the player's UI will display key information.



Player Name: Displays the player's unique in-game name.



Health: A crucial metric indicating the player's life.



Stats: Displays the player's four core attributes: Strength, Construction, Dexterity, and Intelligence.



Stat Point Allocation: A "Set Stat Points" button allows new players to allocate their starting stat points to their desired attributes.



5\. The Server: The Game's Brain

The Server is the logical core of the game. It is a standalone executable that can be run on its own without the Editor.



Hosting: The server hosts a TCP socket and runs a continuous Game Loop to update the game state and broadcast changes to all clients.



Data Management: Loads player data on login, saves any changes, and handles the usecode scripts for all in-game events.



Export Options: The Editor can export a standalone client executable and a headless server executable for a localized version of the game. This headless server is a distinct product of the Editor, allowing the game to be run for single-player or LAN play without the full development toolset present.
